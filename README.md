# PacMen-Exercise
In this project, my classmates and used JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create stylized eyes that follow the computer cursor as it moves across the screen.

# How to Run:
Go to the PacMen-Exerise repository.
-Select "Clone" to clone files onto your computer.
-Go to your file browser on your computer.
-Open cloned PacMen-Exerise file folder.
-Select the index.html and open it using your internet browser.

# Future Improvements:
I want to have the Pacmen face the direction in which they are moving.
